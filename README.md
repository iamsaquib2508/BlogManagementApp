# Blog Management App

## Introduction
This repository is dedicated for a full-stack web app for blog management. It contains two projects, one for backend and frontend each. The backend project is based on `.NET` in `C#` whereas the frontend project is completed using `Angular` in `Javascript`. "Code-first" approach in `Entity Framework` ORM was taken for the database communications. At some point in the future, I intend to add unit testing to it since I know basically nothing about testing.

## Objective

The core purpose of this project is to learn these 2 frameworks and prepare a solid full-stack project with all the industry-standard best practices in place. A very large part of the project was guided by `ChatGPT`. This is a completely personal project aiming to improve my skillset.

For design decisions, the first priority always was to ensure maintaining coding conventions that would/should be present in a big team of 15+ members. The conventions can include readability, maintainability, scalability in terms of code etc. Some of the best practices were adopted from my experience as a software engineer at [Enosis Solutions](https://www.enosisbd.com/), Dhaka. The commit messages and repository structure follow a convention suggested by ChatGPT. It seemed good enough to me, so I will follow it.

Second priority was to pack the project with features that would give me most breadth on relevant topics. Sometimes, a difficult alternative was decided for the sake of learning.

The `/docs` folder might contain more details on design decisions for major commits. Summaries of major milestones will be mentioned in this readme.
